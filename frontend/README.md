# Knockout skeleton [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)

TODO:
- use promise library (when.js as it has many stars on github and is the fastest one)
    - before do this, must use proper RequireJS (got issue module not defined in when.js when trying use when.js)
    - https://github.com/cujojs/when/blob/master/docs/installation.md

    - http://martinfowler.com/articles/asyncJS.html#AWhirlwindIntroductionToPromises

- use a proper RequireJS module (the implementation given by brunch seems not compliant? / cannot load eg when.js)
