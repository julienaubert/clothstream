== TODO ==

once bower pkg fixed, add to bower.json: "knockout-js-infinite-scroll": "0.1.0"

== Patterns ==

Do: Update state on front-end only after receiving success from server.
Otherwise we can get into an inconsistent state, causing frustrations to users and hard-to-debug bug-reports.


== Frontend ==

Pre-requisites, install:

    node-js/npm
    npm install -g brunch bower
    gem install bundler

cd frontend
bower install
npm install
./bower_assets.sh
bundler install

NOTE: do not use gem directly, e.g. if you run brunch before bundler install it may ask you to do: gem install sass
don't do it! use bundler install (because the latter ensures you install a compatible version and not the latest one)


After this can run front-end server which will reload automatically if change anything in frontend/app/*

    brunch w -s
